### **Perpouse of this repo**
this repo was built for the first part of the first assignment in the course Systems programing.
### **More About The Assignment**
#### **First part** 
The first part of the assignment was to write all the tests for the code. With a defined minimum of 20 tests.

#### **Second part** 
The second part of the assignment is to write the code of the snowman. We needed to write two files,
* snowman.hpp 
* snowman.cpp 

one header file defining the funciton signature in the ariel namspace:
**string  snowman(int num)** 

And the other one implenting the ariel namespace and the snowman function.
